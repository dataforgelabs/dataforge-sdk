## DataForge SDK Samples and Community Connectors
Welcome to the DataForge SDK Samples and Community Connectors repository.

This repo serves two main purposes:

- **Samples**
  - First-party examples provided by the DataForge team.
  - Act as a practical "user manual" for the DataForge SDK.
  - Show end-to-end patterns for building custom process code (e.g. custom ingestion, parse, post-output, loopback) and interacting with DataForge from different platforms.
- **community-connectors**
  - A space for the DataForge community to build, share, and maintain reusable connectors and integrations.
  - Focused on real-world integrations with third-party APIs, databases, and services.

Together, these areas help you both **learn how to use the SDK** and **leverage or contribute community-built integrations**.
